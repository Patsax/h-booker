# H-Booker


## Description
Booking a hotel can be frustrating in these modern times. Comparing prices, considering add-on services, and cluttered UI are prevalent in most modern hotel booking applications. In creating this application, our goal was to create something that solved the primary needs of the user and offered a simple, low stress option for selecting a room, with no fluff, no ads to close or minimize, and simple, functional design. 

## Concept

* As a user, I want a simple app to book a hotel room
* As a user, I want to be able to choose a start date and end date
* As a user, I want to be able to see deluxe rooms or non-deluxe rooms
* As a user, I want to be able to view the details of each room

* NodeJS
* Axios
